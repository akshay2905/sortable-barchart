# Sortable - Barchart

## About
A Sortable D3.js Bar chart with tooltip function. I customised this chart to display feedback scores of lecturers.This chart was apart of a bigger MIS system. The Feedback score takes out the average score of 4 parameter. The chart can be customised for more parameters. As the number of feedback providers was irregular, the feedback data shows average score of the class. The tooltip provides cummulative scores of individual parameters. The graph accepts data in JSON format. Though I desinged it for a Ruby on Rails project, this graph can work for any framework. The JSON format can vary, but suitable changes need to be made to d3 code.
